    <p><strong>Kavum</strong> is a traditional Sri Lankan sweet that's deep-fried until golden brown and crispy. It’s made with rice flour, jaggery, and coconut milk, offering a rich, flavorful treat that’s perfect with a cup of tea or coffee!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups rice flour</li>
      <li>1 cup jaggery (grated or in block form)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp cardamom powder (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp cinnamon powder (optional)</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp yeast (optional, for soft kavum)</li>
      <li>Water as needed</li>
      <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small saucepan, melt the jaggery with a little water (about 1/4 cup) until it's completely dissolved.</li>
      <li>Once the jaggery mixture is ready, strain it to remove any impurities and allow it to cool slightly.</li>
      <li>In a large bowl, combine the rice flour, cardamom powder, cinnamon powder, and salt. Add the melted jaggery to the flour mixture.</li>
      <li>Gradually add coconut milk and mix until you form a smooth dough. If the dough is too dry, add a little water, a tablespoon at a time.</li>
      <li>If you’re using yeast, dissolve it in a little warm water and add it to the dough. Let it rise for about 30 minutes in a warm place.</li>
      <li>Once the dough is ready, pinch off small portions and shape them into small balls or discs (about 1-1.5 inches in diameter).</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep pan or wok over medium heat. To test if the oil is hot enough, drop a small piece of dough into the oil—if it rises to the top immediately, the oil is ready.</li>
      <li>Carefully drop the shaped dough balls into the hot oil and fry them, turning occasionally until they are golden brown and crispy on all sides (about 5-7 minutes).</li>
      <li>Remove the Kavum from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
      <li>Allow the Kavum to cool before serving. They are best enjoyed when they are warm, but they can also be stored in an airtight container for a few days.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips & Variations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To make your Kavum extra crispy, ensure the oil temperature is just right—not too hot or too cool.</li>
      <li>If you prefer a different flavor, try adding a few drops of vanilla extract or some grated nutmeg to the dough.</li>
      <li>For a more authentic flavor, you can use treacle instead of jaggery, though jaggery is the more common choice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Enjoy Kavum as a delicious snack with a hot cup of Ceylon tea.</li>
      <li>It also pairs well with a traditional Sri Lankan breakfast or dessert table.</li>
      <li>These treats are perfect for festive occasions, like Sinhala and Tamil New Year or weddings.</li>
    </ul>
