    <p><strong>Mani Pittu</strong> is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from rice flour and grated coconut, often served for breakfast or dinner. It’s a versatile dish that can be paired with curries, sambol, or even just a bit of coconut milk and sugar for a sweeter option!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups rice flour (or Pittu flour)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup grated fresh coconut</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt (adjust to taste)</li>
      <li>1 cup warm water (adjust for consistency)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp ghee (optional, for extra flavor)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp cumin powder (optional, for flavor)</li>
      <li>1-2 tbsp coconut milk (for serving)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine rice flour, salt, and cumin powder (if using).</li>
      <li>Add grated coconut to the flour mixture and mix well to distribute the coconut evenly.</li>
      <li>Slowly add warm water, a little at a time, mixing with your hands until the dough resembles coarse crumbs or sand. You may need to adjust the water to get the right consistency.</li>
      <li>Once the dough is ready, lightly grease a Mani Pittu maker or a metal steam container. Place some of the dough into the bottom, followed by a layer of grated coconut. Repeat this process until the container is full.</li>
      <li>Steam the mixture over medium heat for 15–20 minutes or until the Mani Pittu is fully cooked and a pleasant aroma is emitted.</li>
      <li>Remove from the steamer and gently unmold the Pittu. Serve immediately while hot with a side of curry, sambol, or coconut milk and sugar.</li>
    </ol>
