    <p><strong>Pol Sambol</strong> is a traditional Sri Lankan coconut sambol that pairs beautifully with rice, hoppers, or string hoppers. Made from freshly grated coconut, chili flakes, and a few simple spices, it's a spicy and flavorful side dish!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup freshly grated coconut (or desiccated coconut, if fresh is unavailable)</li>
      <li>2–3 dried red chilies (adjust for heat preference)</li>
      <li>1–2 green chilies (optional, for added spice)</li>
      <li>1 small onion (finely chopped)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp chili powder (optional for extra heat)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp lime juice</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt (or to taste)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp Maldive fish (optional, for authentic flavor)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp sugar (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Start by dry-roasting the dried red chilies in a pan for a few minutes until they are slightly browned and fragrant.</li>
      <li>Once roasted, grind the chilies into a powder using a pestle and mortar or a grinder. You can also grind the green chilies if you prefer a spicier sambol.</li>
      <li>In a bowl, combine the freshly grated coconut with the ground chili powder, chopped onions, and chili powder (if using).</li>
      <li>Add Maldive fish (if using), sugar, salt, and lime juice to the coconut mixture.</li>
      <li>Mix everything thoroughly until the coconut is well-coated with the spices and flavors. Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt or lime juice if needed.</li>
      <li>If you want the sambol to be a little wetter, you can add a small splash of water or coconut milk, but traditionally, it’s dry.</li>
      <li>Serve immediately with rice, hoppers, string hoppers, or even as a condiment for bread or roti.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips & Variations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For a milder version, you can reduce the number of chilies or remove the chili powder altogether.</li>
      <li>If you don't have fresh coconut, you can use desiccated coconut but try to hydrate it slightly with a little water or coconut milk.</li>
      <li>To make it more tangy, add more lime juice or even a small amount of tamarind paste.</li>
    </ul>

      <li>Pair it with hoppers or string hoppers for a traditional breakfast or dinner.</li>
