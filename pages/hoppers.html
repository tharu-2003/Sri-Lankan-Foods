    <p><strong>Hoppers</strong> (also called "Appa") are a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from a fermented rice flour batter, served crispy on the edges and soft in the center. They are often enjoyed with curry, sambol, or even a fried egg in the middle for extra flavor!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups rice flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup plain flour</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 tsp yeast</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups coconut milk</li>
      <li>1/2 cup warm water (for activating yeast)</li>
      <li>Oil for greasing the pan</li>
      <li>Optional: 1-2 eggs (for egg hoppers)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small bowl, activate the yeast by dissolving it in warm water with sugar. Let it sit for 10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
      <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine rice flour, plain flour, salt, and baking powder. Mix well.</li>
      <li>Once the yeast mixture is frothy, add it to the flour mixture along with coconut milk. Stir until the batter is smooth and thick.</li>
      <li>Cover the bowl and let the batter ferment for 6-8 hours or overnight at room temperature.</li>
      <li>Once the batter is fermented, heat an appa pan (hopper pan) or a small non-stick frying pan over medium heat and lightly grease with oil.</li>
      <li>Pour a ladleful of batter into the pan and swirl the pan to spread the batter in a thin layer along the sides, leaving the center thicker.</li>
      <li>Cover and cook for about 5 minutes, or until the edges are crispy and the center is soft and cooked through.</li>
      <li>If making egg hoppers, crack an egg into the center of the hopper once the batter begins to set, then cover and cook for another 3 minutes.</li>
      <li>Repeat with the remaining batter and serve hot with your favorite curry, sambol, or chutney.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tips & Variations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>If you don’t have an appa pan, you can use a regular non-stick frying pan to make the hoppers.</li>
      <li>For extra flavor, try adding a bit of jaggery or coconut sugar to the batter.</li>
      <li>Hoppers are best enjoyed fresh and hot, so cook in batches and serve immediately!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Serving Suggestions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Serve with a coconut sambol, dhal curry, or any meat curry of your choice.</li>
      <li>For a more indulgent dish, make "egg hoppers" by cracking an egg into the center of each hopper during cooking.</li>
    </ul>
