    <h1>Kokis (Sri Lankan Crisp Snack)</h1>
    <img src="/assets/images/kokis-page.jpg" alt="Kokis" class="main-image" />

    <p><strong>Kokis</strong> is a delicious Sri Lankan deep-fried crispy snack, made from rice flour and coconut milk. It is often served during festive occasions like Sinhala and Tamil New Year. The dough is flavored with a hint of turmeric and shaped into beautiful patterns before frying.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups rice flour</li>
      <li>1/2 cup coconut milk</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sugar (optional, for sweetness)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp turmeric powder</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp caraway seeds (optional)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp cumin powder (optional)</li>
      <li>Water (as needed to form the dough)</li>
      <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix the rice flour, turmeric powder, salt, and optional cumin and caraway seeds.</li>
      <li>Add the coconut milk to the flour mixture and stir well.</li>
      <li>Gradually add water, a little at a time, until you get a smooth dough. The dough should not be too soft or too stiff; it should be pliable enough to roll out.</li>
      <li>Let the dough rest for about 10-15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Roll the dough out onto a flat surface into a thin sheet. You can use a rolling pin to flatten it.</li>
      <li>Cut the dough into desired shapes. Traditionally, Kokis is made into flower or square shapes using a special Kokis mold. If you don't have a mold, you can simply cut them into squares or triangles.</li>
      <li>Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. To check if the oil is ready, drop a small piece of dough into the oil. If it rises immediately to the surface, the oil is hot enough.</li>
      <li>Carefully drop the shaped dough pieces into the hot oil and fry until golden brown and crispy, turning them occasionally to ensure even cooking.</li>
      <li>Once fried, remove the Kokis from the oil and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</li>
      <li>Allow them to cool completely before serving. They will become even crispier as they cool down.</li>
    </ol>
