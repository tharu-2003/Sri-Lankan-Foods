    <h1>Asmi (Sri Lankan Sweet)</h1>
    <img src="/assets/images/asmi-page.jpg" alt="Asmi" class="main-image" />

    <p><strong>Asmi</strong> is a traditional Sri Lankan sweet made from rice flour, coconut milk, and sugar. It is usually prepared during special occasions like Sinhala and Tamil New Year and served with a variety of other sweets. The delicate crispy layers are soaked in sugar syrup, making them sweet, chewy, and delicious!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups rice flour</li>
      <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp turmeric powder (optional, for color)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp vanilla essence (optional)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 cup water (for syrup)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp ghee or butter</li>
      <li>Oil for frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large bowl, mix the rice flour, turmeric powder, and coconut milk to form a smooth batter.</li>
      <li>Heat a pan and add ghee or butter, then pour in the batter in small batches. Fry each batch on medium heat, spreading it thinly to form a flat, round pancake-like shape. Fry until golden brown on both sides.</li>
      <li>Once all the pancakes are fried, set them aside to cool slightly.</li>
      <li>In a small saucepan, combine sugar and water, and heat over medium heat until the sugar dissolves and a syrup forms. Let the syrup simmer for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
      <li>Cut the cooled pancakes into strips or squares. Place the pieces in a shallow dish or tray.</li>
      <li>Pour the sugar syrup over the fried pieces, making sure they are well-soaked.</li>
      <li>Allow the Asmi to absorb the syrup for at least 1 hour to allow the layers to soften and the sweet syrup to soak in.</li>
      <li>Serve and enjoy this delicious Sri Lankan sweet!</li>
    </ol>
